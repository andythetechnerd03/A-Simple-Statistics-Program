# A Simple Statistics Program
## Introduction
This program allows you to input a number of data points and it calculate virtually everything from the mean, variance, standard deviation , to testing hypothesis using the Z-test and T-test, oh and it can do a bunch of silly little plots as well (basically everything learnt in AP Statistics code-ified)

## Functionalities
1/ Import Data <br>
2/ Input Data (as an alternative) <br>
3/ Calculate all necessary parameters (mean, variance, standard variation, etc.)  <br>
4/ Calculate z-score, t-score <br>
5/ Hypothesis tests <br>
6/ Linear regression (check for regression-ability -> if yes, build the equation) <br>
7/ Graph them! <br>
8/ Exit <br>
